# Etch-a-Sketch

## about:
This program will mimic an etch-a-sketch where it will draw an a canvas of 16x16 grid and has a reset button to cleanse the canvas. Later upgrades will involve an eraser option, rainbow pen, and increase the canvas from 16x16 to 30x30.

## psuedocode
* create a 16x16 canvas of div boxes
* the cursor will draw on the canvas when it __hovers__ over the div boxees
* reset button to cleanse canvas
